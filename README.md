# Chroma Reveal
## Description
#### shapes 
- the main shapes in this artwork are the combined circles that form the basis for the generative brush. The circles in the main line are most opaque and they fade out as you move further from the line. This creates an ombre effect on the generative brush.
#### colors
- the colors of the brush are mirrored from the web camera, this is achieved by the ofcolor and ofgetpixel.
#### concept
- this project aimed to create a fun and interactive artwork, that combines the webcamera and interactivity through the trackpad. This project is inspired by scratchcards where you would have to scratch the surface of the card to reveal a message or an image.
#### story
- the story lies in the stages of getting to the revealed image. Initially, the web camera is displayed, that is the first stage. The more you utilize the brush to create strokes the further you develop your artwork and the more you reveal the webcamera.

## Process
Initially, the idea of the project was to utilize the web camera as a color palette so that the user could use the mouse to select a color for the paintbrush. Later, we developed the idea of using the function ofgetpixel to get the color of the pixel manually through code. The selected pixel at this stage was the center pixel of the web camera. Finally, we decided to reflect the web camera through a white background.
When we developed the camera idea, we went onto the brush. 
We first started thinking about creating a generative art design, not just a brush, but as we tried creating it, the idea of the brush seemed more interesting as the user could create their design and not let the program create it for them, it also made it more interactive hence more engaging with the user.

## Personal Evaluation
### Fatema
I am very happy with the general outcome, I did not expect it to reflect the webcam so well on the brush, but we were trying as we go seeing what kind of results we got and changing what we didn't like, it was really fun to make.
### Maria
overall, I'm pleased with the outcome. I enjoyed making this interactive project and the synergy. To further develop this artwork, perhaps adding somewhat of an effect to the web camera before drawing it, for example, a glitched camera or a broken screen effect would have been fun.
