## Description
### shapes 
- the main shapes in this artwork are the combined circles that from the basis for the generative brush. The circles in the main line are most opaque and they fade out as you move further from the line. This creates an ombre effect to the generative brush.
### colors
- the colors of the brush are mirrored from the webcamera, this is achieved by the ofcolor and ofgetpixel.
### concept
- the aim of this project was to create a fun and interactive artwork, that combines the webcamera and interactivity throught the trackpad. This project is inspired by scratchcards where you would have to scratch the surface of the card to reveal a message or an image.
### story
- the story lies in the stages of getting to the revealed image. Initially, the webcamera is displayed, that is the first stage. The more you utilize the brush to create strokes the further you develop you artwork and the more you reveal the webcamera.
