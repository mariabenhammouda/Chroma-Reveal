## Description
**shapes** 
- the main shapes in this artwork are the combined circles that from the basis for the generative brush. The circles in the main line are most opaque and they fade out as you move further from the line. This creates an ombre effect to the generative brush.
### colors
- the colors of the brush are mirrored from the webcamera, this is achieved by the ofcolor and ofgetpixel.
### concept
- the aim of this project was to create a fun and interactive artwork, that combines the webcamera and interactivity throught the trackpad. This project is inspired by scratchcards where you would have to scratch the surface of the card to reveal a message or an image.
### story
- the story lies in the stages of getting to the revealed image. Initially, the webcamera is displayed, that is the first stage. The more you utilize the brush to create strokes the further you develop you artwork and the more you reveal the webcamera.

## Process
Initially, the idea of the project was to utilize the webcamera as a color palette so that the user can use the mouse to select a color for the paint brush. Later, we developed the idea of using the function ofgetpixel to get the color of the pixel manually through code. The selected pixel at this stage was the center pixel of the webcamera. Finally, we decided that the reflecting the webcamera through a whitebackground.

## Presonal Evaluation
### Fatema
### Maria
overall, im pleased with the outcome. I enjoyed making this interactive project and the synergy. To further develop this artwork, perhaps adding somewhat of an effect to the webcamera before drawing it, forexample a glitched camera or a broken screen effect would have been fun.
